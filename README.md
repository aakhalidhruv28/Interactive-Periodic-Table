## ‚ú® Features

This project goes beyond a simple table and includes a powerful set of interactive features:

*   **Complete Element Data:** Displays all 118 elements with detailed information fetched dynamically from a public API.
*   **Modern & Responsive UI:** A sleek, dark-themed design that is easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Dynamic Data Loading:** Element data is loaded from the [Periodic-Table-JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON/master/PeriodicTableJSON.json) API, ensuring the information is up-to-date and the application is lightweight.
*   **Interactive Search:** Instantly find elements by typing their name, symbol, or atomic number. Non-matching elements are dimmed for clarity.
*   **Category Filtering:** Filter the table to highlight specific element groups (e.g., Noble Gases, Halogens) using a simple dropdown menu.
*   **Temperature Slider:** A dynamic slider that allows you to change the ambient temperature (in Kelvin) and see the elements change their state (Solid, Liquid, Gas) in real-time.
*   **Detailed Element Modal:** Clicking on an element opens a detailed pop-up view with properties like:
    *   Atomic Mass, Number, and Symbol
    *   Category and Phase at STP
    *   Density, Melting, and Boiling Points
    *   A brief summary and discovery information
    *   A direct link to the element's Wikipedia page for further reading.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was built using only core web technologies, without any frameworks or libraries.

    *   Fetching data from a third-party API (`fetch` API).
    *   Dynamically generating the periodic table grid.
    *   Handling all user events for search, filtering, and the temperature slider.
    *   Managing the modal pop-up.
